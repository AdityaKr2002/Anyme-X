## Scope of AnymeX

You acknowledge that:

## Privacy Statement
AnymeX prioritizes your privacy and does not collect or store personal information on our servers. Here's how your data is handled:
- **Authentication Tokens**: AnymeX uses authentication tokens for AniList, MyAnimeList, and Simkl to enable tracking functionality. These tokens are stored securely on your device only and are never transmitted to or stored on our servers.
- **Third-Party Services**: When you authenticate with AniList, MyAnimeList, or Simkl, their respective APIs handle your data. AnymeX does not access, store, or process your login credentials or personal information beyond facilitating these connections. Please review the privacy policies of these services:
  - [AniList Privacy Policy](https://anilist.co/terms)
  - [MyAnimeList Privacy Policy](https://myanimelist.net/about/privacy_policy)
  - [Simkl Privacy Policy](https://simkl.com/privacy/)
- **Crash Reports and Analytics**: AnymeX does not currently collect crash reports or analytics data. If this changes in the future, we will update this document and provide options to opt out where applicable.

We implement appropriate security measures to ensure authentication tokens are stored securely on your device. We do not sell or share your information with third parties, except as required by law or to facilitate core app functionality through the integrated services.
